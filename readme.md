by `Olivier Louvignes`

## DESCRIPTION ##

This repository contains several plugins for Sencha Touch 2.0, for now most of them are graceful native upgrades for IOS.

* Ext.ux.MessageBox : graceful upgrade to native `UIAlertView`. Phonegap counterpart [here](https://github.com/mgcrea/phonegap-plugins/tree/master/iPhone/MessageBox).

* Ext.ux.ActionSheet : graceful upgrade to native `UIActionSheet`. Phonegap counterpart [here](https://github.com/mgcrea/phonegap-plugins/tree/master-actionsheet/iPhone/ActionSheet).

* Ext.ux.PickerView : graceful upgrade to native `UIPickerView`. Phonegap counterpart [here](https://github.com/mgcrea/phonegap-plugins/tree/master-pickerview/iPhone/PickerView).

## SETUP ##

Using graceful upgrades plugins requires [iPhone PhoneGap](https://github.com/cordova/cordova-ios).

1. Make sure your PhoneGap Xcode project has been [updated for the iOS 4 SDK](http://wiki.phonegap.com/Upgrade-your-PhoneGap-Xcode-Template-for-iOS-4)
2. Follow setup instructions concerning the Phonegap counterpart you will need.
3. Just include the .js file.

## BUGS AND CONTRIBUTIONS ##

Patches welcome! Send a pull request. Since this is not a part of PhoneGap Core (which requires a CLA), this should be easier.
